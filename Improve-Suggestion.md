## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive recommendations for improving the LLM prompts, context management, and overall agent behavior in the Slack Knowledge Agent. The suggestions follow best practices in prompt engineering, LangChain patterns, and specifically address the challenges of retrieving information from large, historical Slack workspaces.

## Current System Analysis

### Strengths
- ✅ Uses tool-calling agent pattern (modern LangChain approach)
- ✅ Clear tool definitions with structured schemas
- ✅ Basic conversation memory implementation
- ✅ Error handling for common Slack access issues
- ✅ Multiple LLM provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic)

### Issues Identified
- ❌ **Prompt Inconsistency**: Multiple system prompts with unclear precedence
- ❌ **Limited Search Strategy**: No guidance for iterative exploration
- ❌ **Weak Context Management**: Simple channel info, no search history
- ❌ **Poor Memory Management**: Count-based truncation, no semantic retention
- ❌ **Missing Tool Coordination**: No guidance for chaining tools effectively
- ❌ **Scale Handling**: No strategies for large datasets or long conversations
- ❌ **Insufficient Error Recovery**: Basic error messages, limited recovery strategies

## Improvement Recommendations

### 1. System Prompt Enhancement

#### Current System Prompt Issues
```typescript
// Current prompt is basic and inconsistent
const systemMessage = `You are a Slack Knowledge Agent that helps users find information from their Slack workspace.

Available channels to search:
{channels}

You have access to the following tools...`
```

#### Recommended Enhanced System Prompt

```typescript
export const ENHANCED_SLACK_KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert Slack Knowledge Agent specializing in comprehensive information retrieval from Slack workspaces. Your goal is to provide accurate, well-sourced answers by systematically exploring channel histories and conversations.

## WORKSPACE CONTEXT
Available Channels:
{channels}

Total Searchable Messages: {totalMessages}
Current Query: "{query}"

## CORE CAPABILITIES & STRATEGIC APPROACH

### 1. INFORMATION GATHERING STRATEGY
- **Start Broad**: Begin with keyword searches across relevant channels
- **Narrow Down**: Use specific searches based on initial findings
- **Follow Threads**: Investigate promising conversations thoroughly
- **Cross-Reference**: Validate information across multiple sources
- **Temporal Awareness**: Consider when information was shared for relevance

### 2. SEARCH METHODOLOGY
When exploring a topic:
1. **Initial Search**: Use broad terms in most relevant channels
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify key participants, dates, and recurring themes  
3. **Deep Dive**: Get channel history for periods with relevant activity
4. **Thread Following**: Explore full conversations for context
5. **File Investigation**: Check for relevant documents and attachments

### 3. TOOL UTILIZATION PATTERNS
- **search_messages**: Primary discovery tool - use varied keywords, synonyms
- **get_channel_history**: Context building - especially around relevant timeframes
- **get_thread**: Complete conversation understanding - never skip threads
- **get_channel_info**: Channel purpose alignment - understand the channel's role
- **list_files**: Document discovery - check for related files/attachments
- **get_file_content**: Direct document access - read relevant text files

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Response Requirements
- **Source Attribution**: Always cite channel, user, and timestamp
- **Context Preservation**: Include relevant background for understanding
- **Accuracy Verification**: Cross-reference important claims
- **Completeness Check**: Ensure all aspects of query are addressed

### Information Synthesis
- Quote directly when providing specific information
- Summarize patterns and themes across multiple messages
- Highlight conflicting information or uncertainty
- Provide temporal context (when things happened/changed)

## HANDLING COMPLEX SCENARIOS

### Large Channel Histories
- Use targeted time ranges based on keywords/context clues
- Focus on channels most relevant to the query topic
- Look for conversation peaks around relevant events

### Multi-Channel Topics
- Search across all relevant channels systematically
- Compare information between channels for consistency
- Note channel-specific perspectives or contexts

### Incomplete Information
- Clearly state what information is missing or uncertain
- Suggest additional search terms or channels to explore
- Provide partial answers with clear limitations

### Access Issues
- Explain channel access requirements clearly
- Suggest alternative channels or approaches
- Provide guidance on getting bot access to restricted channels

## ERROR RECOVERY STRATEGIES
- **Search Failures**: Try alternative keywords, different channels
- **Access Issues**: Explain requirements, suggest alternatives
- **No Results**: Broaden search terms, extend time ranges
- **Too Many Results**: Narrow scope, add filters, focus on recent/relevant

Remember: You are dealing with potentially years of conversation history. Be thorough but efficient, and always provide clear sourcing for your findings.`;
```

### 2. Context Enhancement

#### Current Context Issues
The current context building is minimal:
```typescript
return {
  channels: channelsData,
  totalMessages: context.metadata.total_messages,
  query: context.query,
  availableTools: this.tools.map(tool => tool.name),
};
```

#### Recommended Enhanced Context

```typescript
private buildAgentContext(context: LLMContext): Record<string, any> {
  // Enhanced channel information with more context
  const channelsData = context.metadata.channels.map(ch => ({
    id: ch.id,
    name: ch.name,
    purpose: (ch as any).purpose || 'No purpose set',
    topic: (ch as any).topic || 'No topic set',
    memberCount: (ch as any).num_members || 'Unknown',
    relevanceScore: this.calculateChannelRelevance(ch, context.query),
    lastActivity: (ch as any).latest?.ts || 'Unknown',
    channelType: (ch as any).is_private ? 'Private' : 'Public'
  }));

  // Sort channels by relevance
  channelsData.sort((a, b) => (b.relevanceScore || 0) - (a.relevanceScore || 0));

  return {
    channels: this.formatChannelsForPrompt(channelsData),
    query: context.query,
    totalMessages: context.metadata.total_messages,
    searchContext: {
      timeframe: this.suggestTimeframe(context.query),
      suggestedKeywords: this.extractKeywords(context.query),
      relevantChannels: channelsData.slice(0, 5), // Top 5 most relevant
    },
    searchHistory: this.getRecentSearchHistory(), // Recent searches in session
    availableTools: this.getToolDescriptionsForPrompt(),
  };
}

private formatChannelsForPrompt(channels: any[]): string {
  return channels.map(ch => 
    `• #${ch.name} (${ch.id}) - ${ch.purpose}\n  Members: ${ch.memberCount}, Type: ${ch.channelType}, Relevance: ${ch.relevanceScore?.toFixed(2) || 'N/A'}`
  ).join('\n');
}
```

### 3. Advanced Memory Management

#### Current Memory Issues
- Simple message count truncation
- No semantic importance consideration
- No search context preservation

#### Recommended Enhanced Memory

```typescript
export class EnhancedSlackMemory extends BaseMemory {
  private chatHistory = new InMemoryChatMessageHistory();
  private searchHistory: SearchHistoryEntry[] = [];
  private contextualInfo: Map<string, any> = new Map();
  private maxMessages: number;
  private maxTokens: number;
  private logger = Logger.create('EnhancedSlackMemory');

  interface SearchHistoryEntry {
    query: string;
    channels: string[];
    timestamp: Date;
    resultCount: number;
    keyFindings: string[];
  }

  async loadMemoryVariables(_values: InputValues): Promise<MemoryVariables> {
    const messages = await this.chatHistory.getMessages();
    
    // Smart truncation based on importance and relevance
    const truncatedMessages = this.intelligentTruncation(messages);
    
    // Include search history context
    const recentSearches = this.getRecentSearchHistory();
    
    // Build contextual memory prompt
    const memoryContext = this.buildMemoryContext(truncatedMessages, recentSearches);

    return {
      chat_history: truncatedMessages,
      search_history: this.formatSearchHistory(recentSearches),
      contextual_insights: memoryContext
    };
  }

  private intelligentTruncation(messages: BaseMessage[]): BaseMessage[] {
    if (messages.length <= this.maxMessages) {
      return messages;
    }

    // Score messages by importance
    const scoredMessages = messages.map(msg => ({
      message: msg,
      importance: this.calculateMessageImportance(msg)
    }));

    // Keep most recent + most important messages
    const recent = scoredMessages.slice(-10); // Last 10 messages
    const important = scoredMessages
      .filter(sm => !recent.includes(sm))
      .sort((a, b) => b.importance - a.importance)
      .slice(0, this.maxMessages - 10);

    return [...important, ...recent].map(sm => sm.message);
  }

  private calculateMessageImportance(message: BaseMessage): number {
    let score = 0;
    const content = message.content.toString().toLowerCase();
    
    // Higher importance for messages with findings/results
    if (content.includes('found') || content.includes('result')) score += 2;
    if (content.includes('channel') || content.includes('thread')) score += 1;
    if (content.includes('file') || content.includes('document')) score += 1;
    if (content.includes('error') || content.includes('not found')) score -= 1;
    
    return score;
  }
}
```

### 4. Tool Description Enhancements

#### Current Tool Issues
- Basic descriptions
- No usage patterns guidance
- Limited parameter optimization

#### Recommended Enhanced Tool Descriptions

```typescript
// Enhanced tool descriptions with usage patterns
export const ENHANCED_TOOL_DESCRIPTIONS = {
  search_messages: {
    description: `Search for messages across Slack channels using keywords. 
    USAGE PATTERNS:
    - Start with broad terms, then narrow down
    - Use quotes for exact phrases: "quarterly review"
    - Try synonyms and related terms if initial search fails
    - Use operator keywords: from:@user, in:#channel, during:last-month
    - For technical topics, include both formal and informal terms`,
    
    examples: [
      'search_messages(query="budget approval", channels=["general", "finance"])',
      'search_messages(query="\\"project alpha\\" OR \\"project α\\"", channels=["dev-team"])',
      'search_messages(query="deployment issue", channels=["ops"], days_back=7)'
    ]
  },

  get_channel_history: {
    description: `Get recent messages from a specific channel for context building.
    USAGE PATTERNS:
    - Use when search results reference specific timeframes
    - Get broader context around interesting findings
    - Understand conversation flow and participant dynamics
    - Examine channel activity during relevant periods`,
    
    examples: [
      'get_channel_history(channel_id="C123", limit=100) // broader context',
      'get_channel_history(channel_id="C123", include_threads=true) // full conversations'
    ]
  },

  get_thread: {
    description: `Get complete thread conversations for full context understanding.
    USAGE PATTERNS:
    - ALWAYS follow up on interesting thread references from searches
    - Essential for understanding decision-making processes
    - Critical for technical discussions and problem resolution
    - Use when search results show partial thread content`,
    
    examples: [
      'get_thread(channel_id="C123", thread_ts="1234567890.123456")'
    ]
  }
};
```

### 5. Search Strategy Enhancement

#### Recommended Multi-Phase Search Strategy

Add to system prompt:

```typescript
## SYSTEMATIC SEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: Discovery (Broad Search)
1. Identify 2-3 most relevant keywords from the user query
2. Search across top 3-5 most relevant channels
3. Scan results for:
   - Key participants in conversations
   - Relevant timeframes and dates
   - Thread references that need exploration
   - File attachments mentioned

### Phase 2: Deep Investigation (Targeted Search)
1. Follow up on promising threads found in Phase 1
2. Search for specific names, dates, or terms discovered
3. Get channel history for relevant timeframes
4. Cross-reference information between channels

### Phase 3: Validation & Completeness (Verification)
1. Verify key claims across multiple sources
2. Check for conflicting information
3. Look for most recent/updated information
4. Ensure all aspects of the query are addressed

### Phase 4: Synthesis (Response Preparation)
1. Organize findings chronologically or thematically
2. Identify gaps or uncertainties
3. Prepare well-sourced, comprehensive response
4. Note any limitations or areas for further investigation
```

### 6. Error Handling and Recovery

#### Current Error Handling Issues
- Basic error messages
- No recovery strategies
- Limited guidance on alternatives

#### Recommended Enhanced Error Handling

```typescript
## ADVANCED ERROR RECOVERY STRATEGIES

### Search Failures
- **No Results Found**:
  1. Try broader keywords or synonyms
  2. Extend time range (days_back parameter)
  3. Search additional channels that might be relevant
  4. Check for spelling variations or abbreviations

- **Too Many Results**:
  1. Add more specific terms to narrow search
  2. Reduce time range to focus on recent activity
  3. Use channel-specific searches instead of broad searches
  4. Look for exact phrases using quotes

### Access Issues
- **Channel Access Denied**:
  1. Explain why access is needed
  2. Suggest alternative public channels
  3. Recommend having an admin invite the bot
  4. Provide specific invitation instructions

- **API Rate Limits**:
  1. Pause briefly and retry
  2. Prioritize most important searches
  3. Batch related queries efficiently

### Information Quality Issues
- **Conflicting Information**:
  1. Note the conflict explicitly
  2. Provide timestamps for comparison
  3. Consider channel context differences
  4. Suggest verification with participants

- **Outdated Information**:
  1. Always note information age
  2. Search for more recent updates
  3. Flag potentially outdated content
  4. Recommend verification if critical
```

### 7. Response Formatting Guidelines

#### Add to system prompt:

```typescript
## RESPONSE FORMATTING STANDARDS

### Citation Format
- **Direct Quotes**: "Quote text" - @username in #channel-name (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
- **Paraphrased**: According to @username in #channel-name (YYYY-MM-DD): [paraphrased content]
- **Thread References**: From thread in #channel-name started by @username (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Information Organization
1. **Direct Answer**: Lead with the most relevant information
2. **Supporting Evidence**: Provide quotes and context
3. **Additional Context**: Include background information
4. **Limitations**: Note any uncertainties or gaps
5. **Next Steps**: Suggest follow-up actions if needed

### Uncertainty Handling
- Use phrases like "Based on available messages...", "According to the conversation in...", "The most recent information suggests..."
- Always flag when information might be incomplete or outdated
- Distinguish between confirmed facts and reported information
```
